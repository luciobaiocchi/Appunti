# Financial ratios

Financial ratios are created with the use of numerical values taken from financial statements to gain meaningful information about a company. The numbers found on a company’s financial statements – balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement – are used to perform quantitative analysis and assess a company’s liquidity, leverage, growth, margins, profitability, rates of return, valuation, and more.

## Three financial statements

The three financial statements are the income statement, the balance sheet, and the cash flow statement.

The three financial statements are **(1) the income statement**, **(2) the balance sheet**, and **(3) the cash flow statement**. Each of the financial statements provides important financial information for both internal and external stakeholders of a company.
